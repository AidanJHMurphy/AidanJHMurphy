- 🌱 I've been a professional software developer for since 2015 (mostly back end, but a fair amount of front-end thrown in there too). I'm constantly trying to learn and grow in order to find out the best of what's available (and un-learn any bad habits I've picked up). Currently enjoying go and might possibly dip my toes into rust.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any fun, open-source project
- 📫 How to reach me AidanJHMurphy@Gmail.com or on discord as Aidan Murphy#4673
